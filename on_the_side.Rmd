### <u></u>

- I enjoy doing film photography, developing my own photos whenever I have the time and space. You can see some of my photos and prints [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YBSiTp9PrWmGvBQt5).

- From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a teacher in a public high school in Madrid implementing the Global Classrooms program. Read about the program and my experience with it [here](https://madelineswarr.wixsite.com/moocfinalproject).

- Since 2021, I have been volunteering as an English teacher and soccer coach for the [Dragones de Lavapi√©s](https://dragonesdelavapies.com/), a grassroots soccer club with an incredible mission. If you're interested in learning more or collaborating with us, please reach out!  

- As a music lover, I collaborated with [Rock With This/theXchange](https://www.thexchange.live/) writing music reviews of songs we thought were worth sharing with the world. See the links below for some of my curations!
